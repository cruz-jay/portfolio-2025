React + Vite + Vercel
This repository, portfolio-2025, is hosted on Vercel with the domain "headspaceandtiming.com" being managed through GoDaddy.

The domain name "Head-Space & Timing" refers to: a tool for a .50 caliber machine gun ensures the weapon is set up safely by adjusting the distance between the bolt face and the cartridge (headspace) and ensuring the firing pin releases at the correct moment (timing). Proper use of the tool prevents malfunctions, excessive wear, or dangerous misfires.

The project consists of a main page along with 3 routes leading to individual project introductions:

useBeatBot
useMap
useX86

Each project showcases different technologies and skill sets.
