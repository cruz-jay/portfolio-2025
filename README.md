React + Vite + Vercel
This repository, portfolio-2025, is hosted on Vercel with the domain "headspaceandtiming.com" being managed through GoDaddy.

The domain name "Head-Space & Timing" refers to: a tool for a .50 caliber machine gun ensures the weapon is set up safely by adjusting the distance between the bolt face and the cartridge (headspace) and ensuring the firing pin releases at the correct moment (timing). Proper use of the tool prevents malfunctions, excessive wear, or dangerous misfires.

The project consists of a main page along with 3 routes leading to individual project introductions:

useX86
useMap2
useCert
Each project showcases different technologies and skill sets.

Note: useCert is currently partially functional due to ongoing database migration from SQLite to PostgreSQL on Railway. While the schema and authentication are set up, data transfer is still in progress.

No sensitive information is stored in useCert, and all emails and passwords are for demonstration purposes only.
